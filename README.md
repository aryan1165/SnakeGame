# SnakeGame
Check out our very first gaming project made with Pygame - a simple yet fun snake game! While it may not be the most professional game out there, it was a great learning experience for us as we dived into the world of game development and programming. Created as a project for DSA using Pygame, this game demonstrates basic programming concepts and provides an engaging way to learn the fundamentals of game development.

## Goal
You play as a hungry snake that grows longer as it eats food, but be careful not to run into walls or your own tail! Go get the snake eat all the apples!

## Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
